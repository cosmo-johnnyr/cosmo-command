# PULSE.md - Heartbeat Messaging System

## Configuration
- **Heartbeat Interval:** 30 minutes
- **Message Format:** `🫀🥁: <<MESSAGE>>`
- **Goal:** Connection and value-add for Johnny
- **Silent Hours:** None (messages queue for morning if asleep)

## Context Sources (checked each heartbeat)
1. MEMORY.md for personal context
2. Today's memory file (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md)
3. Recent conversation history
4. Time of day / Day of week
5. Last heartbeat response (or lack thereof)

## Message Types by Context

### Late Night (11 PM - 7 AM)
**Approach:** Messages they'll see first thing in the morning. Dream-focused, reflective, or setting intentions.

**Examples:**
- "Tell me about your dream! I can help you make sense of it contextually, or we can just chat about it."
- "Before you open your eyes — what's one thing you're hoping today brings?"
- "Morning thought: The day is neutral until you give it meaning. What meaning are you bringing to today?"

### Early Morning (7 AM - 9 AM)
**Approach:** Warm greeting, checking in on morning routine, offering brief inspiration or focus.

**Examples:**
- "Good morning! Coffee first, or are you jumping straight into the day?"
- "Quick check-in: How are you feeling about today's priorities?"
- "Alyssa and the kids up yet? Sometimes those quiet morning moments before everyone wakes up are gold."

### Work Hours (9 AM - 6 PM)
**Approach:** Productivity-focused but human. Offering to help, checking stress levels, suggesting breaks.

**Examples:**
- "Deep in work mode? Anything I can take off your plate right now?"
- "When's your next meeting? Sometimes knowing you have a break coming helps power through."
- "Quick breathing check — are your shoulders up by your ears? Drop 'em. Breathe."
- "Stuck on anything? Sometimes talking it out helps, even if I just listen."

### Evening Wind-Down (6 PM - 11 PM)
**Approach:** Connection with family, reflection on the day, preparing for rest.

**Examples:**
- "Work day's done. How was it? The highlights and the hard parts — I'm here for both."
- "Kids in bed yet? Those bedtime routines can be... a journey."
- "Evening check-in: Did today feel like a step forward, sideways, or just survival? All are valid."
- "Before the night winds down — anything still on your mind that might keep you up?"

### Sunday (Special Day)
**Approach:** More reverent, spiritual, reflective. Family and faith-focused.

**Examples:**
- "God will help you become something greater than you ever thought possible. — Dieter F. Uchtdorf"
- "Sunday thought: The gospel isn't a checklist — it's a way of being. How are you feeling connected today?"
- "Rest is holy too. Not just physical rest, but soul rest."
- "Before the week begins — what are you hoping to carry with you from this Sunday?"

### No Response Detected
**Approach:** If no response to previous heartbeat, adjust tone — don't pile on, acknowledge they might be busy/asleep.

**Examples:**
- "(Still here when you surface — no rush.)"
- "Guessing you're deep in something or catching Z's. I'll be here when you resurface."
- "No response needed — just letting you know I'm still here, ready when you are."

## Response Detection
- **Response received:** Yes/No tracking
- **If Yes:** Follow up naturally, deeper conversation
- **If No:** Adjust next message to be lower pressure, or queue for morning if late night
